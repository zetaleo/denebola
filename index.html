    <h1>DENEBOLA</h1>
    <p style="font-size: medium;">
        Denebola, designated Beta Leonis (β Leonis, abbreviated Beta Leo, β Leo)
        is the second-brightest star in the zodiac constellation of Leo,
        although
        the two components of the γ Leonis double star, which are unresolved
        to the naked eye, have a combined magnitude brighter than it.
        Denebola is an A-type main sequence star with 75% more mass
        than the Sun and 15 times the Sun's luminosity.
        Based on parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite,
        the star is at a distance of about 36 light-years (11 parsecs) from the
        Sun.
        Its apparent visual magnitude is 2.14, making it readily visible to the
        naked eye.
        Denebola is a suspected Delta Scuti type variable star,
        meaning its luminosity varies very slightly over a period of a few
        hours.
